*   **Powerful Animation System:** Bring your worlds to life with skeletal animation, morph targets, and intuitive animation graphs, all enhanced by a rich set of easing functions.
*   **Responsive UI & Input:** Craft dynamic user interfaces with a flexible UI system, comprehensive input handling (keyboard, mouse, gamepad, touch, gestures), and built-in accessibility features.
*   **Cross-Platform by Design:** Develop once and deploy across multiple platforms, including desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux), Android, and WebAssembly (WASM), thanks to its WGPU-based rendering backend.
*   **High-Performance & Multithreaded:** Engineered for speed, Bevy fully utilizes modern CPUs with its parallel task system, ensuring smooth gameplay and efficient resource management.
*   **Extensible & Modular:** Bevy's plugin-driven architecture means you only include what you need, allowing for deep customization and effortless integration of third-party libraries.
*   **Developer-Friendly Tooling:** Integrated diagnostics, FPS overlays, and debugging utilities streamline development and optimization.

## Who is this for?

*   **Game Developers:** Whether you're an indie developer with a dream or part of a larger studio, Bevy's performance and productivity features make it an excellent choice for crafting compelling games.
*   **Engine & Tool Developers:** Its open-source nature, modular design, and low-level control make it an ideal foundation for building custom engines, specialized tools, or extending existing functionalities.
*   **Rust Enthusiasts:** For those passionate about Rust, Bevy offers a unique opportunity to build graphics-intensive applications in a safe, fast, and modern environment.
*   **Technical Artists & Researchers:** Explore advanced rendering techniques, procedural generation, and complex simulations with Bevy's flexible shader system and comprehensive math library.

## Technology Stack & Architecture

*   **Core Language:** Rust
*   **Primary Backend (Rendering):** WGPU (abstraction layer for Vulkan, Metal, DirectX 12, OpenGL ES, WebGPU)
*   **Architectural Pattern:** Entity Component System (ECS)
*   **Platform Abstraction:** Winit (for windowing and input on desktop), Android NDK (for mobile), WebAssembly (for web).
*   **Asset Management:** Custom asset pipeline, supporting common formats like GLTF, PNG, OGG, TTF.
*   **Serialization:** RON (Rusty Object Notation) is frequently used for asset and scene definitions.
*   **Concurrency:** Bevy's custom task system for efficient multithreaded processing.

## ðŸ“Š Architecture & Database Schema

The Bevy engine operates on a highly modular, data-driven architecture. The core principle is the Entity Component System (ECS), which decouples data (Components) from behavior (Systems) and provides a unique identifier (Entity) to group them. This enables parallel processing and flexible data structures.

## âš¡ Quick Start Guide

To get started with Bevy, ensure you have Rust installed. Then, follow these steps:

1.  **Create a new Rust project:**
    ```bash
    cargo new my_bevy_game
    cd my_bevy_game
    ```

2.  **Add Bevy as a dependency** in your `Cargo.toml`:
    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    bevy = "0.13" # Or the latest version
    ```

3.  **Write your first Bevy app** in `src/main.rs`:
    ```rust
    use bevy::prelude::*;

    fn main() {
        App::new()
            .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
            .add_systems(Startup, setup)
            .run();
    }

    fn setup(mut commands: Commands) {
        // Spawn a camera
        commands.spawn(Camera2dBundle::default());
        // You can add more entities here
        info!("Hello from Bevy!");
    }
    ```

4.  **Run your application (release mode recommended for performance):**
    ```bash
    cargo run --release
    ```
